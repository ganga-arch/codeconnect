To understand the concepts:

state ===> [export const varaible]===> mention the initial State of the component 

Actions ===> [export const varaible] ===> mention the actions required todo like 
                                          createPosts,UpdatePost,Delete

Reducer ====> [export function ] ==> it is a pure function. here we will update the state
                                     based on the action we do from initial state to current state.

Effects ====> [service file] ==> it a service. based on the actions, it will update 
                                 the state through service
